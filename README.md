# SNUsort

SNUSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm, which combines Randomized Quicksort with Insertion sort. 
In SNUSort, Randomized Quicksort runs recursively until the subarrayâ€™s size is less than some value, k.

In SNUSort, the average-case runtime of Partial-Quicksort is O(nlog(nk )), and the average-case runtime of Insertion-sort is O(nk). 
Thus, in total, SNUSort runs in O ( n k + n l o g ( nk ) ) .
